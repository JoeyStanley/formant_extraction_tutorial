This is a tutorial that guides you Praat scripting with the goal of writing a script that automatically extracting vowel formant measurements. Part 1 introduces scripting and focuses only on TextGrids. I'll introduce audio in Part 2 end by the end of it, you should have a basic working script. Part 3 is optional but expands the script to make it more flexible and help you save time later.

These tutorials are an update to ones I published previously on my personal website. The end product is more or less the same, but the explanation on how to get there has been completely rewritten.

Part 2: Acoustic Measurements
